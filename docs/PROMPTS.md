# Prompts Reference Guide

**Create intelligent conversation templates that guide developers through complex workflows.**

Prompts in MCP Dev Blueprints are pre-configured conversation starters that provide structured, guided interactions for common development tasks. They're perfect for standardizing workflows, onboarding new team members, and ensuring consistent processes across your organization.

## üéØ What Are MCP Prompts?

Prompts are conversation templates that:
- **Guide Workflows** - Lead developers through multi-step processes
- **Ensure Consistency** - Standardize how tasks are approached
- **Transfer Knowledge** - Embed institutional wisdom into everyday workflows  
- **Reduce Cognitive Load** - Provide structure for complex decisions
- **Enable Self-Service** - Help developers solve problems independently

### Prompt vs. Tool vs. Resource

| Type | Purpose | Interaction Style | Example |
|------|---------|------------------|---------|
| **Prompt** | Guided conversation | Interactive, multi-turn | "Code Review Wizard", "Project Setup Guide" |
| **Tool** | Instructions & reference | One-time information | "Coding Standards", "API Guidelines" |
| **Resource** | Static documentation | Reference lookup | "API Spec", "Architecture Docs" |

## üé® Conversation Design Best Practices

### Writing Effective Conversation Starters

#### 1. **Clear Context Setting**
```markdown
## ‚úÖ Good: Specific and Actionable
"I'm about to deploy a critical hotfix to production and need to follow our emergency deployment process..."

## ‚ùå Avoid: Vague and Generic  
"I need help with deployment..."
```

#### 2. **Progressive Information Gathering**
```markdown
## Multi-layered Information Collection

### Initial Context (required)
- What: [SPECIFIC_TASK_OR_PROBLEM]
- When: [TIMELINE_AND_URGENCY]  
- Who: [STAKEHOLDERS_AFFECTED]

### Technical Details (if applicable)
- Technology stack: [RELEVANT_TECHNOLOGIES]
- Environment: [DEV/STAGING/PRODUCTION]
- Scale: [USERS_AFFECTED/DATA_SIZE/TRAFFIC]

### Constraints & Requirements
- Must-haves: [NON_NEGOTIABLE_REQUIREMENTS]
- Nice-to-haves: [PREFERRED_OUTCOMES]
- Blockers: [CURRENT_OBSTACLES]
```

#### 3. **Tool Integration Strategy**
```markdown
## Effective Tool Orchestration

1. **First**: Use 'relevant_standards_tool' to establish baseline understanding
2. **Then**: Apply specific diagnostic or analysis tools  
3. **Finally**: Use 'documentation_tool' to capture decisions and outcomes

This creates a complete workflow that leverages your knowledge base effectively.
```

### Conversation Flow Patterns

#### Linear Workflow Pattern
```json
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Execute this step-by-step process:\n\n**Step 1**: Initial assessment using diagnostic tools\n**Step 2**: Problem analysis with relevant checklists  \n**Step 3**: Solution implementation with best practices\n**Step 4**: Validation and documentation\n\nLet's start with Step 1..."
    }
}
```

#### Branching Logic Pattern
```json
{
    "role": "user", 
    "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Help me choose the right approach based on my situation:\n\n**If** this is a new feature ‚Üí Use 'feature_development_guide'\n**If** this is a bug fix ‚Üí Use 'debugging_methodology'\n**If** this is a refactor ‚Üí Use 'refactoring_checklist'\n\nMy situation: [DESCRIBE_YOUR_CASE]\n\nBased on this, which path should we take?"
    }
}
```

#### Iterative Refinement Pattern  
```json
{
    "role": "user",
    "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Let's iterate on this solution together:\n\n**Round 1**: Initial approach and quick validation\n**Round 2**: Refinement based on feedback and constraints\n**Round 3**: Final optimization and implementation planning\n\nI'll provide context, you'll suggest approaches, and we'll refine until we have the optimal solution.\n\nStarting context: [INITIAL_SITUATION]"

## üìä Prompt Performance & Analytics

### Measuring Prompt Effectiveness

#### Usage Metrics to Track
- **Completion Rate**: How often users complete the full workflow
- **Success Outcomes**: Whether the prompt achieves its intended goal  
- **Time to Resolution**: How quickly users solve their problems
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback on helpfulness and clarity
- **Return Usage**: How often users return to the same prompt

#### A/B Testing Prompt Variations

```json
// Version A: Detailed upfront information gathering
{
    "id": "detailed_onboarding_v1",
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
            "text": "Complete this detailed form first, then I'll provide customized guidance: [LONG_FORM]"
        }
    }]
}

// Version B: Progressive disclosure approach
{
    "id": "progressive_onboarding_v2", 
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": {
            "text": "Let's start with the basics and I'll ask follow-up questions as we go: [SIMPLE_START]"
        }
    }]
}
```

### Prompt Optimization Strategies

#### Iterative Improvement Process
1. **Collect Usage Data** - Track how prompts are used in practice
2. **Identify Pain Points** - Where do users get stuck or drop off?
3. **Test Variations** - A/B test different approaches
4. **Measure Impact** - Does the change improve outcomes?
5. **Scale Successful Patterns** - Apply learnings to other prompts

#### Common Optimization Areas
- **Information Gathering Order** - What to ask first vs. later
- **Instruction Clarity** - Reducing ambiguity and confusion
- **Tool Integration** - More effective use of knowledge base tools
- **Conversation Length** - Balancing thoroughness with usability
- **Error Recovery** - Handling unexpected user inputs gracefully

Let's ensure it meets our highest standards:\n\n## Pre-Review Setup\n**Pull Request Information:**\n- Repository: [REPO_NAME]\n- Feature description: [WHAT_DOES_THIS_DO]\n- Risk assessment: [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH]\n- Deployment timeline: [WHEN_WILL_THIS_GO_LIVE]\n\n## Multi-Dimensional Review Process\n\n### üîí **Security Review**\nFirst, let me use our security tools:\n1. Use 'security_code_scanner' to check for vulnerabilities\n2. Use 'authentication_patterns' tool for auth-related changes\n3. Use 'data_privacy_checklist' for data handling code\n\n### ‚ö° **Performance Review**\n1. Use 'performance_patterns' tool for optimization guidelines\n2. Check database query efficiency\n3. Validate caching and resource usage\n4. Review algorithmic complexity\n\n### üß™ **Quality & Testing**\n1. Use 'testing_standards' tool for test coverage requirements\n2. Verify edge case handling\n3. Check error handling and logging\n4. Validate API contract stability\n\n### üèóÔ∏è **Architecture & Maintainability**\n1. Use 'architecture_patterns' tool for design consistency\n2. Review code organization and modularity\n3. Check documentation and comments\n4. Validate naming and conventions\n\n### üöÄ **Deployment Readiness**\n1. Use 'deployment_checklist' for production requirements\n2. Verify configuration management\n3. Check monitoring and alerting\n4. Review rollback procedures\n\n## Review Execution\nI'll guide you through each dimension systematically, providing specific feedback templates and escalation criteria.\n\n**Let's start: What type of code changes are we reviewing, and what's the risk level?**\n\nI'll begin by loading the appropriate security and quality tools..."
